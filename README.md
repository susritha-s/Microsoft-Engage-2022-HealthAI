# HealthAI- A disease diagnosis Web Application

In today's busy world, people neglect their symptoms and do not get them diagnosed due to lack of time. This can lead to health complications, as early detection is the key.</br>
HealthAI is a solution to all these problems , as it is Free, Simple, Accurate and Quick.


# FutureScope

In further iterations, I plan to add more and more diseases to the list and make it a one stop destination for diagnosis.
